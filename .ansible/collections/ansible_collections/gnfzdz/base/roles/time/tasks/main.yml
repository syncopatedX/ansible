## TODO Maybe figure out a better test for whether this will work? It definitely fails inside
## containers. Also, should it actually short-circuit when /etc/adjtime exists? What if the
## current value is inaccurate? Maybe not a huge concern as according to the hwclock
## manpages most linux systems call the below command on shutdown.

  ansible.builtin.command:
    cmd: hwclock --systohc
    creates: /etc/adjtime
  when: ansible_virtualization_role is defined and ansible_virtualization_role == 'host'
